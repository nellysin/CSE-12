Lab 2: Simple Data Path

--------------
DESCRIPTION

This lab describes a data circuit of storing and moving multiple bits and utilizing
them to create a new hexdecimal through the ACL formed by different use of muxes or
multiplexers.

FILES
- 
Lab2.lgi

This file is a .lgi and if performed by MMLogic or Mulimedia Logic it must be run in 
the MMLogic. It contains the circuits to be performed. 

--------------
INSTRUCTIONS
This program is intended for the Mulimedia Logic or MMLogic.
The user will input one hexdecimal (0-9, A-F) and select a register to which they will 
store the input. User will then select which register to be bitwise artihmetic left shift 
as an output. Finally, the user can store the output in one of the 4 registers.
